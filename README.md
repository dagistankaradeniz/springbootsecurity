# Run Steps
There is nothing special to run this example. Just be sure your 8080 port is not assigned to another application :+1:

## SecurityConfiguration.java 
Just comment one of the (numbered) configure(){..} methods and re-run application
Use your favorite rest client (mine is postman plugin of chrome brw)
And test with the users inside SecurityConfiguration.java file, without any authentication params, with wrong params etc.

Good Luck :wink:
